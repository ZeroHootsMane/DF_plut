Oh yea!
Come on!

You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color

Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers

In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star

You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show

You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that
It's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds
